					<h1>LIVES part.1</h1>

					<h3>Daron Malakian and Scars On Broadway</h3>
					<p>Everybody dance, when you dance, when you wanna dance<br>
					When you wanna dance, you will get in a trance<br>
					Everybody sees, what they see, what they wanna see<br>
					Everyone believes what they never have seen<br>
					Come with me let's go,<br>
					Where we trace back the lives that show<br>
					You will never know<br>
					Unless you come with me, let's go<br>
					Everybody dance, when you dance, when you wanna dance<br>
					When you start to dance, you will get in a trance<br></p>

					<p>All of our lives we put up a fight<br>
					Our heroes have died<br>
					All of our lives we've known wrong from right<br>
					Our people survived<br></p>

					<p>Everyone get high<br>
					There's no need to justify<br>
					Everyone get high<br>
					There's no need to justify<br>
					We will occupy<br>
					And we all know the reasons why<br>
					We will occupy<br>
					And we drink tea till we die<br>
					Knowing something<br></p>
